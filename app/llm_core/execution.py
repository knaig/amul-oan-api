"""LLM tier execution policy.

See docs/oss-fallback-design.md. One mechanism, used by every unary pipeline
(pretranslation, moderation, suggestions): a resolved pipeline *variant* becomes
an ordered *attempt chain* — ``[oss, managed]`` for OSS sessions, ``[managed]``
otherwise — and ``execute_with_fallback`` walks it, classifying each failure,
falling back on infrastructure errors, and recording every failure for the
``oss_fallback`` metric.

This module is deliberately inside :mod:`app.llm_core`: application services do
not choose tiers, inspect fallback flags, or implement retry loops.

Core-chat streaming uses ``stream_with_fallback`` (first-token commit): an OSS
failure *before* the first token swaps to managed transparently; once the first
token has reached the caller a swap is impossible, so the error propagates.
The common stream state machine owns both time-to-first-token and commit state.

    can't just shorten the model's httpx read-timeout, which can't tell a silent
    pre-first-token hang from a normal inter-token gap.

    The agent stream (which carries pydantic-ai's ``run_stream`` anyio cancel

    through a queue; only the first ``queue.get`` is bounded (``asyncio.wait_for``).
    This is deliberate: ``run_stream``'s cancel scope is opened, advanced AND closed
    within that one task, while the consumer only ever awaits a plain queue — so
    THIS generator can be ``aclose()``'d from another task (a client disconnect /
    mid-stream ``GeneratorExit``) without ever touching an anyio scope. An earlier
    version wrapped the stream in an ``anyio.move_on_after`` scope that spanned the
    ``yield``s; that crashed on every disconnect with "exit cancel scope in a
    different task" / "aclose: generator already running". Validated against real
    ``run_stream`` incl. the disconnect path.
